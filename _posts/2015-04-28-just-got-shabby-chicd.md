## Lace and Vintage Look

As unique, interesting and challenging as the wedding-theme, **“Shabby Chic”**, implies, we got overly excited in transforming our [Snowy Flowers][sf] in a vial to a <i>**stunning wedding give-away**</i>.

A **soft lace** was carefully tied around the neck of the vial. Added a touch of pastel colored, peach and mint green, **pearl beads** which were meticulously arranged on top of the cork. This perfect combination gave the vials that <i>**vintage look**</i>.

## Hand-sewn
The tags were **hand-sewn** to the lace and intentionally let them freely hang to have that easy and relax feeling. This is also to make the beautiful Snowy Flowers inside the vials very visible.

A white organza bag just perfectly sealed the Shabby Chic look of the vials.
