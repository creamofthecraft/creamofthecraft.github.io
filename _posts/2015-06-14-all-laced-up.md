## All Laced-up!
 
Yes, we do love **Details**! Nothing is too intricate nor too much for a Crafting savvy like us and so we are all in for Mark and Kit’s wedding.

Gold and white motif is an elegant choice. So, the right materials that would best fit their theme were carefully selected. A pretty **white scallop-edged lace** would definitely add class and texture to our Snowy Flowers in shot glasses and vials. And we are just loving each detail that were incorporated. Everything is getting more exciting from here.

The tags were crafted with 3 layers of materials adding more dimensions to it. Ideas and materials were generously poured in just to create a unique beautiful tag.

The second layer is a glittering gold paper. Giving the punched-heart a gold glittery effect to match the motif. And of course, adding a white lace with a gold gem for more texture." %}

Playing around with our metallic gold Sharpie. Handmade it is and hand-drawn as well. Giving the tags for our shot glasses a bolder and eye-catching heart.

So, that’s the story behind these lovely wedding souvenirs for Mark and Kit.

Wait! Who said were done? We mean total package here. That means even the packaging for our Snowy Flowers in shot glasses are laced-up too!

{% include media-image.html file="laced-up-all-set.jpg" title="All Set" caption="Our regular Snowy Flowers set (there’s more designs for the bride’s to choose from). For Kit, it’s a shot glass. It comes with a free bottle spray, instruction card and a personalized paper bag. Spray the flowers with water and it will close. The flowers will bloom when it gets dry. And it can last upto 10 years!" %}


{% include media-image.html file="laced-up-hand-bag.jpg" title="Touch of Innovation" caption="Have we mentioned that this is a regular paper bag with strings as handles? Yes, it is. The original strings were replaced with a cute white ribbon with gold hem lines. Giving it a new look and making it an adorable packaging for our Snowy flowers." %}

So, are you loving the details too? Everything we do here in Cream of the Craft is definitely made with Love.
