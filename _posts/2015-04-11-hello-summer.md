I can undeniably feel the summer heat and I canâ€™t wait to splash to any beach in the Island.

These bright colored sprinklers with Snowy Flowers are just perfect for this Summer.

{% include media-image.html file="sand-796x500.jpg" title="Flowers by the beach" caption="Our colorful summer design - Snowy Flowers in colorful sprinklers" %}

Sand and more sand with variety of shells and beads which I have kept from our Nautical
themed wedding.

I can smell the sea breeze just by looking at it. 

So, getting more excited to go for a swim? Or to grab one of our limited summer designs?
