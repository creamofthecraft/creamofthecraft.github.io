## Purple is the color!

Every wedding is special and all brides-to-be have their own wish lists. Yes it is definitely challenging but this is where things get so exciting. An **explosion of creativity, resourcefulness and innovation** is all we need to come up with a design that’s adorable and which perfectly suits the wedding theme.

## Bejeweled Teddy Bears
These Teddy Bears with Snowy Flowers in a vial keychain is a cute choice. Customizing made it possible for us to have all the teddy bears in Purple.

## Embellished Candy Jars
Snowy Flowers in a candy jar look pretty already on its own. Embellishing it with beads and handmade flowers out of an organza ribbon is nothing else but **Elegance**.

## Purple and White

Purple glass beads are complemented with white pearl beads. These are strung together and placed around the mouth of the jar just like a necklace. A handmade flower made out of an organza ribbon was added to the side. The flower was made of two organza ribbons with different colors and width.

## Best wishes RJ and Erica!

Holding two organza ribbons with different widths is quite tricky. But it’s certainly fun! Make one along with this video.
