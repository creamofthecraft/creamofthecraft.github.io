excerpt: 		That <i>“love-at-first-try”</i> gradually snowballed to a passion. So I enjoyed doing my school projects, made my own invites for my 18th birthday, styled and detailed our Nautical themed wedding and D-I-Y for my sons’ christening and birthdays.

## Real Flowers

Yes! These are real flowers. Snowy Flower is type of chrysanthemum that are processed using frosting technology to sustain the softness and moisture of the flower. Natural oil covers the surface of the flower petals and prevents water molecules to evaporate. This mechanism preserves the flower so it will not fade or wilt.

## They Animate

These flowers are sensitive to water. When sprayed with water the petals close to a bud and after they dry up, the petals open and bloom once again. Isn't that cool?! You have to see it to believe.

They react to the environment too. When it's rainy and cool, the flower feels that and they start to close. And during a sunny day, when the air is dry, the petals bloom again.

## The Perfect Gift Idea

We've arranged these flowers and placed them in cute containers. They are best as a gift or give-aways for any occassion. They last a DECADE ( yes! 10 years ) and they symbolize everlasting love.

Your loved ones will surely appreciate it. They come in small packages and they are easy to maintain. They require less sunlight.

## Here's how it works
